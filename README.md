## About Me üëãüòÑ

Hi, I‚Äôm Herman ‚Äî a front-end software engineer with a love for building intuitive, beautiful, and high-impact web experiences. My path into tech wasn‚Äôt traditional, but that‚Äôs what makes it meaningful. Coming from a non-technical background, I discovered software engineering through curiosity and grit, and quickly realized that front-end development is where my creativity and problem-solving instincts thrive.

I‚Äôm drawn to the challenge of turning complex ideas into user-friendly interfaces, and I enjoy collaborating with teams to bring products to life. I‚Äôve found my groove in fast-paced environments, where a sense of urgency drives focus, ownership, and momentum. Whether I‚Äôm debugging tricky UI issues or designing a smooth user experience, I love the fast feedback loop that front-end work offers ‚Äî and how it constantly pushes me to grow.

Outside of coding, I‚Äôm really into cars ‚Äî I appreciate the design, precision, and engineering behind them. More recently, I‚Äôve picked up Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which has been a humbling and motivating practice that teaches discipline, adaptability, and persistence.

Always learning, always building.
